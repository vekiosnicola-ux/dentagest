## Functional Walkthrough

### 1. Register as a Patient

New users register, fill out medical and contact details, and consent to privacy policies. The registration form uses Zod for validation and react-hook-form for state management.

**Example:**

```tsx
// components/forms/PatientForm.tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { UserFormValidation } from "@/lib/validation";

const form = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(UserFormValidation),
  defaultValues: { name: "", email: "", phone: "" },
});
```

### 2. Book Appointments

Patients view available doctors, select time slots, and provide the reason for their visit. Multiple appointments can be managed. The appointment form integrates with Appwrite for backend operations.

**Example:**

```tsx
// components/forms/AppointmentForm.tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { getAppointmentSchema } from "@/lib/validation";

const form = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(getAppointmentSchema()),
  defaultValues: { schedule: new Date(), reason: "" },
});
```

### 3. Admin Panel

Admins can:

- View all appointments
- Confirm or schedule appointments
- Cancel appointments (with SMS notifications)
- Manage patient records and uploaded documents

**Example:**

```tsx
// app/admin/page.tsx
import { StatCard } from "@/components/StatCard";
import { DataTable } from "@/components/table/DataTable";

<StatCard type="appointments" count={appointments.scheduledCount} label="Scheduled appointments" />
<DataTable columns={Columns} data={appointments.list} />
```

### 4. Notifications

Patients receive SMS notifications on successful appointment confirmation using Twilio integration via Appwrite Messaging.

**Example:**

```typescript
// lib/appwrite.config.ts
export const messaging = new sdk.Messaging(client);
// Use messaging.send() to trigger SMS notifications
```

### 5. Performance and Error Tracking

Sentry integration monitors errors and performance bottlenecks. All major pages and API routes are instrumented with Sentry.

**Example:**

```typescript
// sentry.client.config.ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
Sentry.init({ dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN });
```

### 6. File Upload

Users can upload documents (e.g., insurance, ID) securely using the FileUploader component and Appwrite Storage.

**Example:**

```tsx
// components/FileUploader.tsx
import { storage } from "@/lib/appwrite.config";
const uploadFile = async (file: File) => {
  await storage.createFile(BUCKET_ID, file.name, file);
};
```

---

## Code Examples & Reusability

### Utility Function

```typescript
// lib/utils.ts
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### Patient Form Validation

```typescript
// lib/validation.ts
export const UserFormValidation = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2).max(50),
  email: z.string().email().refine(async (email) => !(await checkEmailExists(email)), "Email already exists"),
  phone: z.string().refine(async (phone) => !(await checkPhoneExists(phone)), "Phone already exists"),
});
```

### Reusing Components

- **CustomFormField:** Use for any form field with validation and custom UI.
- **FileUploader:** Use for uploading files in any form.
- **StatusBadge:** Display status for appointments, patients, etc.

### API Usage

```typescript
// lib/appwrite.config.ts
const client = new sdk.Client();
client.setEndpoint(ENDPOINT!).setProject(NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!).setKey(NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY!);
export const databases = new sdk.Databases(client);
export const users = new sdk.Users(client);
export const messaging = new sdk.Messaging(client);
export const storage = new sdk.Storage(client);
```
